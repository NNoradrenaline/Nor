If you have any problems with attaching and it isn't the executor blocking your VPN then disable windows defender and reinstall Nor. You may turn defender back on after it works.	Do the same if it constantly crashes.
If Nor crashes when you execute a script its highly likely a faulty script. If it's a simple script such as printidentity() or print("Hello, world!") then dm me on discord.
Remember this is a very new Executor and will have many bugs, most problems will get solved in future versions you can check wherever you got this from for new versions if any of these problems apply to you.


If you have any other problems then Dm  @sca.rn on Discord or join the server https://discord.gg/KUMBXMHKPS  

Every executor is currently detected besides Mobile executors such as Delta and Krnl. If you think I should make a mobile version for IOS and Android then Dm me on Discord ( I do not know how to make Mobile apps Lmao )
